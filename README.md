# Recommended Contribution Procedure

1. Clone main.
2. Create branch with the format yourName-day-month (e.g. Andrew-03-05).
3. Push branch to origin.
4. Do the work.
5. Commit to branch and push to origin when finished.
6. Merge branch to main and push to origin at the end of the day.

I don't think we need to bother with pull requests.
